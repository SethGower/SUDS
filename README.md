![SUDS Diagram](https://github.com/SethGower/SUDS/raw/master/SUDS.png)

###Current Progress
LEDs on the wall on exterior of bathroom show the occupancy status of the showers (ON == occupied). Uses limit switches on the shower locks to determine occupancy.

####Parts
1. Various resistors: E-Projects EPC-103/A-0005-A04. 220 ohm(x4) and 110 ohm(x2)
2. Green Light Emitting Diodes
3. Adafruit Perma-Proto HAT for Raspi. P2310
4. Raspberry Pi 2 Model B
5. Limit switch (x2)

###Future Expansion
Will be writing a web app that shows the status of the showers for ease of access. Will possibly collect statistics to create a heat map of when the showers are most used.
